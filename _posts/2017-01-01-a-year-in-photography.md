After finally getting a phone with a decently competent camera (Nexus 6P), I have
been able to take some pretty amazing photos of places I've been. All photos were
taken on auto mode and unedited, save for some basic cropping. In the future, I
am looking automate a lot of photography with robotics in order to generate
stunning timelapses and perhaps even pictures of the moon and planets through a
telescope.
