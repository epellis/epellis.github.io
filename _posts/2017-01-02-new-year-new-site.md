One of the uglier items on my bucket list has been updating my website to make
blogging and editing pages much easier. Back in the days of old, to edit a page,
I would have to edit on the html level, which led to a lot of time being spent
tweaking the look and not as much time spent actually writing. To fix this, I have
completely overhauled the site (again). Project Cassida is built using a neat service called [Jekyll][jekyll-site]. This is helpful because it can automatically
rebuild my site every time a new page is added. To give flair to the site, and avoid
raw html being displayed, I am using [Slim for Jekyll][slim-github] as a minimal
theme for my website. Similar to Project Tarvos, all files are hosted on github.io
and edited through Atom. Hopefully, with a much quicker development process, I can
finally put some content onto my site and build a pretty neat window into my life.
